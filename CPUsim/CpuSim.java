/*
 * Thoughts and stuff:
 * 
 * Small values of lambda (<0.1) causes arrival times to increase.
 * Large values of lambda (>0.1) causes arrival times to decrease
 * 
 * Strengths of this schedule: finishes short jobs quickly
 * Weaknesses of this schedule: no priority or aging on jobs to accommodate important jobs
 * 
 * Program does not "interrupt" to accommodate new jobs. Instead, each job is processed until they are terminated.
