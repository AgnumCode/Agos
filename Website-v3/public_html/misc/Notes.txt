Dynamic forum posts stored in JSON

-Created AngularJS template 
-Used directive to create a 'post' item with all the HTML and styling desired
-Directive contained references to records.data.posts within JSON stored locally
 and retrieved in 'myCtrl' using $http.get() and passing the response to the VM
-ng-repeated over the array of posts[i][post_var1, post_var2, ...] displaying all information accordingly 
-Used $sce and .trustAsHtml passing in raw html from post[i][..., HTML content, ...]
 to properly display the raw text as HTML
-Allowed for direct editing of everything a 'post' item would contain by changing the JSON data file
-Using XAMPP to test server-side was successful and could display all data successfully
-Testing revealed the JSON could handle complex HTML but the styling needed to be included 
-Failure to continue with a database due lack of version access which introduces JSON-mySQL syntax
-Refactored to use traditional mySQL statements for CRUD operations, abandoning all JSON structure.
-Now uses PHP to open connection to db and perform CRUD using mySQL statements.
